## Transactions

Transactions and payments to both content partners and users are executed automatically through smart contracts. These contracts are also be used for verification and on-chain monitoring.

Through this, the network maintains a public record of information on our immutable blockchain. Information about all the transactional operations of Script.TV is available in our block explorer, which functions similarly to EtherScan.

This explorer allows users to conveniently find data on transactions and tokens, information about smart contracts and reports, and can be used to track the latest actions and changes in the blockchain.
